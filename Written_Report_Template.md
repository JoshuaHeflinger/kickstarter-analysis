# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
	The overview of this project was to analyze the kickstarter data based on the theater outcomes based on the launch and the outcomes based on the goals of the kickstarter campaigns.

### Purpose
	The purpose of this project was finding the theater outcomes by the launch date and the outcomes based on the goals. To do this I created a pivot table and filtered it by the parent category and the year. After I did this I had column of outcomes, rows for the date created coversions, and the values were the count of the outcomes. After doing this I created a line graph showing by the month how many of the kickstarter campaigns were successful, failed, and canceled. The next one was based on the goals of the campaigns. The purpose of this one was to create a graph to see the percentage of how many projects were successful, how many failed, and how many were canceled. By doing this I seperated the goals between 0 to over 50,0000. After that I created a =Countifs equation in excel to find the number of projects that were successful, how many failed, and how many were canceled based on the intervals of the goal. After I had figured this out I summed the projects to get the total number of projects. Then after this I divided each column by the total projects column to get the percentages which I then used to create the line graph to show the percentage of the percentage of the projects were successful, how many failed, and how many were canceled. 

## Analysis and Challenges
One of the challenges that I had faced on the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date worksheet was creating the pivot table. After looking at the sheet and seeing how the pivot table should work I tried a few different ways in the Pivot Table fields. This one for me did take several different ways before I found the correct way that it should be formatted. Another challenge I faced was the =Countifs function. The most challenging part of this one for me was filtering the criteria to fit the numbers in the Goal column. My work around this challenge was by watching the video more than a few times on top of trying out a few different functions. 
 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	My analysis of the outcomes based on launch date is that the most successful campaigns happens in the summer. On the months of May, June, and July we can see that they have the highest number of successful campaigns. However these three months also had the highest number of failed campaigns as well. The data also shows that the later half of the year we see that the number of failed campaigns rise while the number of successful campaigns go down. The number of canceled campaigns seems to be pretty consistent between each month with the highest amount of canceled campaigns being from January. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	My analsis of the outcomes based on goals sheet is that the higher the goal is for the campaign the higher the percentage is it'll fail. We see this on the graph as well. When the goal is less than 1000 we see the highest percentage of the number of successful projects. When the goal is at its highest of 50000 or more we have the highest percentage failed projects. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	One of the difficulties that I encountered was making the pivot table look like the one shown on the example. This was overcame by trying out different fields in different areas until they made sense. Another challenged I faced was the countifs function. I had trouble filtering the criteria and making it fit between the numbers for the goals. 

## Results
	The results of that I came up with are the lower the goal the higher it is that it will be successful. The most successful projects were all under 25000. After that the number of failed projects start to rise. I also came up with the conculsion that the most successful projects seem to happen in the summer time. 
	
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	Two conclusions that I can draw on the outcomes based on launch date is May, June, and July are the best time to run a successul projects. The other conclusion that I came up with is that October, November, and December are some of teh worst months to run a successful campaign. The number of successful campaigns are closer to the number of failed campaigns between these months. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	Something that I can conclude on the outcomes based on is that the higher the goal is the higher the percentage is of that project will fail. This is shown through the line graph you can see how the percentage of failed rising as the goal increases. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	The limitations of this dataset that I found was that the graphs don't account for the total number of projects that were done during these months or for the goals. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	I think that another possible table or graph we could of possibly used could have been a bar graph or a box and whisker plot.
